On Mac and Linux, first build or install [the F# 3.0 compiler (open source edition)](http://fsharp.github.com/fsharp) if 'fsharpc' is not on your command line.

Then install the F# Language Binding via the MonoDeveop Add-in manager.

   MonoDevelop 
        --> Add-in manager --> Gallery
        --> Language Bindings --> F# Language Binding

Then do this:

   MonoDevelop 
      --> Options/Preferences --> Source Code --> Code Formatting --> Text File --> Convert tabs to spaces

## Building and installing from scratch

Normally you should get the binding from the repository. If you want to build and install it yourself and develop it, try this:

  ./configure.sh
  make
  make install
